# Hangman Game!

**What is Hangman Game?**

Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game enjoyed by people of all ages. It's a game of deduction, vocabulary, and strategy that requires players to guess letters in order to uncover a hidden word before they run out of attempts. Here's how to play, some rules.

Word Selection: The host should select a word that is challenging but not impossible for the guesser to figure out. Commonly, this word is kept secret until the end of the game.

Guess Limit: Typically, there's a limit to the number of incorrect guesses allowed before the hangman figure is completed. Commonly, this figure consists of a head, body, two arms, and two legs, though variations exist.

Letter Guessing: The guesser can only guess one letter at a time. Guessing entire words or phrases is usually not allowed.

No Repeating Guesses: Once a letter has been guessed, it cannot be guessed again, whether it was correct or not.

**Rules:**

1. **Let's start play Hangman!** Use the command `python main.py` to begin the game.

2. **Start guessing!** Start guessing letters one at a time. If the guessed letter is part of the word, all instances of that letter in the appropriate positions on the dashes. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the host draws part of a hangman stick figure on the gallows (traditionally represented as a vertical line with a horizontal line at the top).

3. **Winning or Losing** If you complete the word, you win! If the hangman is fully drawn before you guess the word, you lose. The game will indicate whether you've won or lost. You can choose to play again by running the command `python main.py` again.
 
**Enjoy playing!**
